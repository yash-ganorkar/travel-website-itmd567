                    <p class="text-bigger">We started to think on a idea which would not be repetitive and be unique on it’s own. We started to look on Google, started to observe the current websites and came to conclusion. We decided to build a website which could allow the users to pay for their transportation. But what’s unique in it and how will it different than the current websites? We came up with an idea of providing an centralized or single application which helps to personalize your trip by picking your favorite place, booking flight tickets, hotels, cars and events and book them all from our application. We decided to add a unique feature of showing and allowing users to get to know what events would be going on during their traveling days. </p>
