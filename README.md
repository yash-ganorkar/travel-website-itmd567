## Inspiration
Identified a potential service update in the travel fare aggregator and travel metasearch engine platforms and designed a alternative for the current system by developing a system which allows users to rent hotel or cars, book airline tickets and search for entertainment options in any city in the US.

## Project Description
TravelToExplore is an online booking agent for the travel enthusiast which allows travellers to book air tickets across the globe, rent hotel or car and browse for cultural and entertaining events across all the cities located in the US.  
TravelToExplore is a 3-tier architecture. It has separate back-end API’s which communicate with various other API’s like Google Flights API, Hotwire.com API to fetch live deals for the requested query, thereby simplifying the code distribution and maintenance process.
